# Useful functions

* my own implementations of different useful techniques

* permutated feature importance for random forests as proposed in Breiman, “Random Forests”, Machine Learning, 45(1), 5-32, 2001 
* partial dependence plots

## Drawback Feature Importance

* when 2 or more features are highly correlated permutation techniques may overestimate one feature while not being able to capture the informatrion of the other features
*  useful for feature selection, not for interpretation
